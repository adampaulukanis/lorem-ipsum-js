# lorem ipsum js generator

This is my take on `Lorem Ipsum generator`. Basically the idea is to always display the same words in the same order. The
only thing you as a user can control is the number of words. By default there are 17 words displayed.

Another good numbers are 32, 66, 97.

## How to use

```console
$ npm start 22
```

or do not provide the argument, as mentioned earlier the default is 17.
